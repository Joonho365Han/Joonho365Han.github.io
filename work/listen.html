        		<h2>LISTEN</h2>
        		<h4>Inspired by Lynn Hirschberg's Screen Tests, Listen is a recording of moments when the interviewees are the most themselves. The initial test videos shown below borrow the interviewing style of Lynn Hirschberg. Progressively, the film will evolve from the interviewing style and find different methods to recored each person. The intent was to figure out </h4>
        		<h3>Motivation</h3>
        		<h4>Starting high school, I came to the states eager to live a different life. I decided to throw myself away and learn how everybody else behaved so I could fit in. Years later, I realized I am beautiful for simply being myself, but I had forgotten about who I am. I needed to learn how to define myself as a person, and decided to look at how others did so. </h4><!--My school in Korea solely evaluated students with exams, but I was much more than a paper. I had artistic hobbies and had a different (weird) personality, and hoped to be more accepted when I came to the states. However, I had made a mistake. In Korea, I was aware of what is "normal" and communicated with people by explaining what I am in a normal context. I felt I needed to do the same in America. Thus, I decided to learn what normal looked like, but by throwing myself away and accepting whatever everyone else did. Years later, I realized my own mistake, but I had forgotten what defined me as a person. I wasted to look how others defined themselves and started to interview them, which would become "Listen".

        			Now I know that America is so diverse that what is normal depends on the context. -->
				<h4>Today, I have a better sense of who I am, but how people define themselves still interests me. More through time, I realize how diverse America is. <!--People who avoided me because I did not "fit in" still existed, while there were also people who were much more accepting. --> In other words, there was no true "normal" person. I became fascinated by how so many people in this country could relate to each other without a definition "normality." Thus, "Listen" now tries to film people and find what part of human do people understand each other.</h4>
