	        		<h4>Monolith is a mobile archive of ancient weapons and history of the Epicross Universe. The Epicross Universe is a fictional background my novel The Seltra takes place in (this Seltra is unrelated with my other project of the same name). In this world, a rogue martial artist Raid Cleric and his comrades handle hundreds of different weapons in a continuous fight. a book about these weapons is called the Archive of weapons. Monolith combines these two books into a compact and virtual medium - a mobile app - to increase their life.</h4>
	        		<h3>Motivation</h3>
	        		<h4>Out of the two books stored in Monolith, The Seltra was written first. Later, when I just had an idea to create the second book - Archive of Weapons - I found the novel Artemis Foul using fake alphabets in the text, inspiring me to do the same. A book about ancient weapons would much easily immerse the reader if written in what seemed like an ancient language. I created random symbols and assigned alphabets to each of them. When I tried writing with them, I noticed that certain symbols were better remembered when associated with one alphabet than the other. After switching some characters, the language 'Hixian' was born. Later during the process of writing the Archive of Weapons, I thought that I could do the same with Seltra. However, because the book was narrated by an omniscient persona, I wanted to create a second language, which would be called "God's language." This was how Seltra was rewritten with orderly and rectangular language, emitting a vibe of an aristocrat's writing.</h4>
