        		<h3>Motivation</h3>
        		<h4>On the start of high school, I came to the states eager to live a different life. My school in Korea solely judged students with exams, but I was much more than a paper. I had artistic hobbies and had a creative (a.k.a. weird) personality, and hoped to be more accepted when I came to the states. Now that I grew up, I know now that this was only a "fantasy." Not to say that America disappointed me, America was simply different: it was much much more more diverse. People who avoided me because I did not "fit in" still existed, while there were also people who were much more accepting. In a sentence, there was no true "normal" person. I became fascinated by how so many people in this country could relate to each other without a definition "normality", and started to interview people, calling it the "Listen" project.</h4>
