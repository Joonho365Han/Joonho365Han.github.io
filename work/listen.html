        		<h2>LISTEN</h2>
        		<h4>Listen is a series of recordings in which I attempt to capture when we are most ourselves. The intention is to learn what part of a human being allows us to feel empathy despite differences. Initially, I borrowed the recording style from Lynn Hirschberg's Screen Tests. Through iterations, the series will evolve and hopefully present every person with different styles. This is an ongoing project, and will mature as I meet different people.</h4>
        		<h3>Motivation</h3>
        		<h4>Starting high school, I came to the states from Korea, eager to live a different life. 

        			To fit in, I decided to throw myself away and learn how everybody else behaved. Years later, I learned the importance who I am, but I had already forgotten about what defined me as a person. I started interviewing others hoping to learn how others achieved this and to learn from them.

        			My school in Korea solely evaluated students with exams, but I was much more than a paper. I had artistic hobbies and had a different (weird) personality, and hoped to be more accepted when I came to the states. However, I had made a mistake. In Korea, I learned what "normal" looked like so I could communicate with normal people. When I came over, I decided to the same, but by throwing myself away and accepting whatever everyone else did. Years later, I realized my own mistake, but I had forgotten what defined me as a person. I wasted to look how others defined themselves and started to interview them, which would become "Listen". What started as an attempt to define myself based on the norm

        			Now I know that America is so diverse that what is normal depends on the context.

        			Today, I have a better sense of who I am, but the way people look at themselves still interests me. More through time, I realize how diverse America is. <!--People who avoided me because I did not "fit in" still existed, while there were also people who were much more accepting like my amazing girlfriend Ashley. --> In other words, there is no true "normal" person. I became fascinated by how so many people in this country could relate to each other without a definition "normality." From this moment, "Listen" changed to pursue its present goal.</h4>
