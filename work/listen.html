        		<h2>LISTEN</h2>
        		<h4>Listen is a series of recordings in which I attempt to capture when we are most ourselves. Through this work, I hope to learn what aspect of a person helps us feel compassion to each other. Initially, I borrowed the recording style from Lynn Hirschberg's Screen Tests, but hopefully the series will evolve and present each person with different styles. This is an ongoing project, and will mature as I meet different people.</h4>
        		<h3>Motivation</h3>
        		<h4>I came to the states at the beginning of high school, eager to live a different life. My middle school in Korea evaluated students solely with exams, but I was much more than a paper. I had artistic hobbies and had a unique (or weird) personality, and hoped to be more accepted when I came to the states. When I came over, however, I decided to throw myself away and learn how everybody else behaved. In Korea, I learned what "normal" looked like so I could communicate with normal people. To do the same in the U.S., I thought throwing myself away was necessary. Years later, I realized I should be proud of who I am, but had already forgotten about what defined me as a person. I wanted to see how others defined themselves and started to interview them, which would become "Listen".</h4>
        		<h4>Today, Listen has a different purpose since I have a better sense of who I am. More through time, I realize how diverse America is compared to Korea. People who avoided me because I did not "fit in" still existed, while there were also people who were much more accepting like my amazing girlfriend Ashley. (I'm not saying Korea is a horrible place, though. I am proud to be Korean.) In other words, there is no true normal person. I was surprised by how so many people in this country could relate to each other without a definition of normality. From this moment, Listen started to pursue its current goal and focused on interpersonal relationships.</h4>
