        		<h2>LISTEN</h2>
        		<h4>Listen is a series of moments recorded when the interviewees are the most themselves. The style of initial test videos shown below are inspired by Lynn Hirschberg's Screen Tests. Progressively, the series will evolve from this style and hopefully present each interviewee from diverse angles. The intent of this work is to learn how people can feel empathy despite the growing diversity and generational gaps in the Unites States.</h4>
        		<h3>Motivation</h3>
        		<h4>Starting high school, I came to the states eager to live a different life. I decided to throw myself away and learn how everybody else behaved so I could fit in. Years later, I realized I am beautiful for simply being myself, but I had forgotten about who I am. I needed a guideline to define myself as a person. I started interviewing others hoping to learn how others achieved this and to learn from them.</h4><!--My school in Korea solely evaluated students with exams, but I was much more than a paper. I had artistic hobbies and had a different (weird) personality, and hoped to be more accepted when I came to the states. However, I had made a mistake. In Korea, I was aware of what is "normal" and communicated with people by explaining what I am in a normal context. I felt I needed to do the same in America. Thus, I decided to learn what normal looked like, but by throwing myself away and accepting whatever everyone else did. Years later, I realized my own mistake, but I had forgotten what defined me as a person. I wasted to look how others defined themselves and started to interview them, which would become "Listen".

        			Now I know that America is so diverse that what is normal depends on the context. -->
				<h4>Today, I have a better sense of who I am, but the way people look at themselves still interests me. More through time, I realize how diverse America is. <!--People who avoided me because I did not "fit in" still existed, while there were also people who were much more accepting. --> In other words, there was no true "normal" person. I became fascinated by how so many people in this country could relate to each other without a definition "normality." From this moment, "Listen" changed its goal.</h4>
