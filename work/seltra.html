		        	<h2>SELTRA</h2>
		        	<h4>Seltra is a concept of a definitive, most beautiful personal object. I attempted several times to create a permanent version since 2008. However, on December 2015, I concluded that it's impossible to finalize the object, because I will grow and change as a person and so will my definition of beauty. Each rendition of Seltra meant many things throughout my life, depending on what I sought the most at a point. It would be fair to say that I felt 'pride' for the first time when I finally completed the very first version of Seltra.</h4>
		        	<h3>Significance</h3>
		        	<h4>Seltra represented different things throughout my life. As a kid, all I wanted was just a cool toy. When I started making my own Seltra, however, it started to hold more meaning than just a toy.</h4>
		        	<h4>The first meaning is, "Do not give up." When I was in junior high in Korea, I grew up with people who didn't believe art was necessary in life, who would sometimes steal and hide my creations. However, I did not mind those who do, and one day, I successfully created the first wristband-style Seltra. No matter how hard anything seems, what you believe in will determine the outcome.</h4>
		        	<h4>The second meaning is "ultimate beauty." I believe that a person's greed can be satisfied by creating a perfectly customized object. In my case, I am obsessed with beautiful things, and I thought Seltra was the most beautiful thing in the world. As long as I believed in this fact, I could keep my interest in watches, cars, and other luxury on a healthy level. Today, since it's difficult to clearly define beauty, Seltra lost this meaning and functionality. Interestingly, however, my obsession with beauty also died as well. It seemed as if Seltra adjusts itself to my needs and desires.</h4>

		        	<h3>Design</h3>
		        	<h4>The official definition of Seltra was coined after I created the first wristband version, but I always had my own treasure since I was a kid. As a child, all I did was to simply decorate a crayon's wrapping paper and pretend it to be a laser shooter. I also heavily wrapped aluminum foil around it so the crayon wouldn't break or scratch due to shock. This "wrapping" would later motivate me to create wooden containers in which I would store Seltra. Over time, I learned how to sculpt, woodwork, and learned about acrylic paint. I started to think more out of the box, and this led me to create a wristband version.</h4>
		        	<h4>I like the shape of the wristwatch. It is easy to wear, durable if constructed carefully, and has very flexible design alternatives. The tricky part was creating an art piece that was small enough to fit in but also felt like it fully utilized the space inside the case. Over time, I realized three things. First, 3 dimensional design looks fuller and satisfying. Second, light affects how you view the object. Filling the case with epoxy allowed 'hovering' art pieces to be made, but refracted the light bouncing off the sculpture. This made the sculpture look flat, which countered the purpose of having a 3-D art piece. Third, Art must stay as art. For the last version of Seltra, I tried to make Seltra look less flamboyant, as I was hearing that the wristband was too flashy. I decided to incorporate a design principle by Leonardo da Vinci, "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." When it was finished I could feel that the wristband lacked visual energy compared to the previous version. Design is meant to make the content stand out by blending in to the surrounding and staying subtle. In art, however, I believe this approach is counter productive. It's important to listen to your heart and create what you want to express, not necessarily what others will enjoy as much as the artist.</h4>

		        	<h3>Production</h3>
		        	<h4>The goal was to create a lifetime object, something that could possibly last longer than myself. I chose stainless steel for the main body, as it was the most accessible and considerably durable material. For the first wristband-Seltra, I used a metal frame from a broken wristwatch and sanded it to create a brushed look. This, however, removed the chrome plating it had, revealing the metal beneath. Although I am not sure what the metal is made out of, it oxidized and stabilized to a dark gray look.</h4>
		        	<h4>There were many trial and errors. Most of the mistakes happened along the way of learning a new technique, which I am proud to say that it eventually contributed to the success of the end product. One time, I accidentally accelerated the rusting of the metal body. I thought acid got rid of rust, and bought a bottle of Clorox and poured it in a mug with Seltra inside. Later, I realized that rust wasn't just coming off, but was also 'growing'; the acid had reacted with the rust.</h4>
