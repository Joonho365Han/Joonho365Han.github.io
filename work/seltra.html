		        	<h2>SELTRA</h2>
		        	<h4>Seltra is a concept of a definitive, most beautiful personal object. I attempted to create different renditions ever since 2008. However, on December 2015, I concluded that it's impossible to crystallize the concept, because I will grow and change as a person and so will my definition of beauty. Each rendition of Seltra meant many things throughout my life, depending on what I sought the most at a point. It would be fair to say that I felt 'pride' for the first time when I finally completed the very first version of Seltra.</h4>
		        	<h3>Symbolism</h3>
		        	<h4>Seltra represented different things throughout my life. As a kid, all I wanted was just a cool toy. When I started making my own Seltra, however, it started to hold more meaning than just a toy.</h4>
		        	<h4>The first meaning is, "Do not give up." When I was in junior high in Korea, I grew up with people who didn't believe art was necessary in life, who would sometimes steal and hide my creations. However, I did not mind those who do, and one day, I successfully created the first wristband-style Seltra. No matter how hard anything seems, what you believe in will determine the outcome.</h4>
		        	<h4>The second meaning is "ultimate beauty." I believe that a person's greed can be satisfied by creating a perfectly customized object. In my case, I am obsessed with beautiful things, and I thought Seltra was the most beautiful thing in the world. As long as I believed in this fact, I could keep my interest in watches, cars, and other luxury on a healthy level. Today, since it's difficult to clearly define beauty, Seltra lost this meaning and functionality. Interestingly, however, my obsession with beauty also died as well. It seemed as if Seltra adjusts itself to my needs and desires.</h4>

	        	<h3>Production</h3>
	        	<h4>The official definition of Seltra was coined after I created the first wristband-style object, but I always had my favorite object since I was a kid. As a child, all I did was to simply decorate a crayon's wrapping paper and pretend it to be a laser shooter. I also heavily wrapped aluminum foil around it so the crayon wouldn't break or scratch due to shock. This "wrapping" would later motivate me to create wooden seals in which I would store Seltra. Over time, I learned how to sculpt, woodwork, and learned about acrylic paint. I started to think more out of the box, and this led me to create a wristband version.</h4>
	        	<h3>Difficulties</h3>
	        	<h4>There were many trial and errors. Most of the mistakes happened along the way of learning a new technique, which I am proud to say that it eventually contributed to the success of the end product. But the most 'memorable' mistake was when I accidentally accelerated the rusting of the metal body. A newly 3-D printed metal might have rust, which could expand and stay in the piece. So, I did a quick research on the internet, and found out that apple cider turns the rust black and easy to brush off. Since I could not find apple cider in my area, I decided to look up anything that had high acid in it, thinking that it was acid that made apple cider work. I bought a bottle of Clorox and poured it in a mug with Seltra inside. Moments later, I noticed that rust wasn't just coming off, but was also 'growing.' I realized that the acid reacted with the rust, but it was too late; the acid got into the micro pores of the 3D print and destroyed the insides.</h4>
