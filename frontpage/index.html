		        		<h4>Here's a story. I thought Do Diligence was an American idiom. I remember hearing the phrase once, and I thought "Hmm, that must be spelled 'Do Diligence.' Wow. Such a cool idiom." Growing up under not-so-conservative Asian parents, I learned to value the process as much as the result. So when I heard this 'idiom,' I thought "Wow. persistence must be a universal trait. I guess I must embrace it." Ironically, the phrase I actually heard was "Due Diligence" which means something completely different. But, thanks to this coincidence, I was able to grow up believing that many things can be done with persistence.</h4>
		        		<h4>Yes. We all know that "Just do it" is a famous trademark of that famous company. Nevertheless, this slogan says the truth. A million dollar idea only turns into cold hard cash when you execute it. I can't say how many times my ideas became real just because I sat down and thought, "You know what? I should just do it." So after Do Diligence, Just Do It is my second most important motto.</h4>

		        		<h4>Joonho Han is a Boston University undergraduate student studying computer engineering. Currently, he is attempting digital art projects to combine his interest for art and computers. When Joonho was a child, he always made spears, sculptures, and drawings from his imagination. After coming to the U.S., Joonho had a hard time figuring out his future. He decided to study engineering, hoping to find something he loves, until now. After a long wait, Joonho finally acknowledged his passion for art, and decided to use his talent in computer engineering to touch people's hearts. </h4>
