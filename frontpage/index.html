        		<h3>Here's a story.</h3>
        		<h4>I thought Do Diligence was an American idiom. I remember hearing something that sounded similar, and I thought "Hmm, that must be spelled 'Do Diligence.'" I was raised in Korea, a goal-oriented society, but my parents made sure I valued the process as much as the result. So when I heard this 'idiom,' I thought "It must mean to be diligent no matter what. Wow. Persistence must be a universal trait. I should stick to it." Ironically, the phrase I actually heard was "Due Diligence" which means something completely different. But, thanks to this coincidence, I grew up believing that a lot can be achieved when you just persist through.</h4>
        		<!--<h4>There's actually another motto I believe in: "Just do it." Yes, We all know that "Just do it" is a famous trademark of that famous company. Unlike most possible assumptions, I use this phrase with a different motif: this slogan says the truth. A million dollar idea turns into cold hard cash only when you execute it. I can't say how many times my ideas became real just because I sat down and thought, "You know what? I should just do it." So after Do Diligence, Just Do It is my second most important motto.</h4>-->
