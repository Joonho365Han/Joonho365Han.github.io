        <h1 style="line-height: 28px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #333333; font-family: Calluna, serif, georgia, serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #fafafa;">After re-visiting my blog after a couple of months, I realized that my blog did not represent me in depth. Although blogs can be anything, this specific blog was meant to have minimum posts that represent my deep interests as a human being. Even if the subjects of the posts were something that I was interested in, it only adhered to my interests to a basic level, without any personal meaning or significance.</h1>
<p style="line-height: 28px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #333333; font-family: Calluna, serif, georgia, serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #fafafa;">I realized that I cannot pretend that a couple of photos related to me actually represent me. I had to actually post something myself. I do not seek popularity or money, but I created this blog to remember what is important to me and to organize my thoughts on what makes me happy contrary to what is simply fun. The posts I had before does not comply to this original reason. Thus, I deleted them all.</p>
<p style="line-height: 28px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: #333333; font-family: Calluna, serif, georgia, serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #fafafa;">And so, I decided to post Seltra, my wristband and my number one treasure, as my first post. Initially I hesitated since I had pride in the fact that I created this wristband myself; from the designs to crafting. I feared that this item would no longer be a one-of-a-kind after I reveal it to the public. However now I understand to a certain degree that nothing is original at this point in the human civilization. I also felt that something about keeping Seltra secret to this degree is absurd; perhaps one of the reasons why is that the old Seltra is actually not that beautiful. Hence, I am making a new one.</p>
