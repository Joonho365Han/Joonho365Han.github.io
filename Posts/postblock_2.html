<h4>Due to the complications related to my summer schedule and the continuing failures on the final step of the tablet, I've decided to take back a step and hold off on the X project. Current outlook indicates the X won't be finished at least until after September. This might change. The minor yet important step of attaching a bezel to the tablet without any fasteners whatsoever is crucial to both the aesthetics and the waterproof functionality of the device. Thus, I cannot rush it and decided to work on it when I will be able to take my time.</h4>

<h4>The X prototype ranked 2nd place for the 2017 Boston University Imagineering Competition. I think it's time to start finishing up the tablet.
