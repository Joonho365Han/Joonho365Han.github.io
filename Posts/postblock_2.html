<h4>The topic that always comes up when talking about privacy is the internet and the devices that are connected to it. So when we are talking about privacy, we are most of the time talking about internet privacy. The problem is, internet is designed from the ground to share ALL information. So when we talk about privacy within the internet, we are essentially adding a direction as to how we WANT the internet to be used, not talking about how it has always been used. This is the part where many people are confused, because thanks to the advance in technology, certain levels of privacy became possible to maintain within the internet. Log-ins and private messages are an example. Therefore, people who grew up with this kind of internet think that internet is has always been secure, which is not true.</h4>
<h4>If we want a technology to be used in a certain way, we must ask about who has the right to decide how the internet is used. How do we balance government’s ability to search criminals while protecting the freedom of the people? Should we treat the internet as the land of the wild where the strong dominates, or should we treat it like a community hall where there are set rules like not looking into people’s stuff without permission? The people can fight for privacy, but do they have the right to control the way the internet is used?</h4>
