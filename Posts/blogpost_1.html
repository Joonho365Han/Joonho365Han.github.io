<h3>New website design</h3>
<h4>Welcome. This is the start of the new design for the website. This is the third version. The new key feature is blogs. I felt the need to have up-to-date content like blogs so I stay connected. Tumblr is great for photos, but not so much for text posts in my opinion. Hope you enjoy!</h4>
