<h4>Due to the complications related to my summer schedule and the continuing failures on the final step of the tablet, I've decided to take back a step and hold off on the X project. Current outlook indicates the X won't be finished at least until after September. This might change. The minor yet important step of attaching a bezel to the tablet without any fasteners whatsoever is crucial to both the aesthetics and the waterproof functionality of the device. Thus, I cannot rush it and decided to work on it when I will be able to take my time.</h4>

<h4>The X prototype ranked 2nd place for the 2017 Boston University Imagineering Competition. I think it's time to start finishing up the tablet.

<h4>Concept: Raspberry pi cluster that is just better. What do I mean by better? I mean that it won't be  just multiple pi's stacked up one another by spacers. There will be an aluminum casing that will also act as the heat sink. The Pi 3s will be thinned down so they can be closely stacked on one another. Power will come from a dedicated power circuit, which removes the need for an external power block. And the coolest of all, they will be a GPU cluster.</h4>

<h4>Personal thought: I noticed how I am more emotionally aware when thinking in Korean. I'm positive this is due to my fluency in Korean. It makes you realize how foundational liberal arts is to people's lives.</h4>
