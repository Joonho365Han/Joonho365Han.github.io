<h4> I've been thinking about this recently, and I realized that privacy actually has many definitions in the context of technology.
  For some people, privacy could mean keeping your files in secret from others. For others, it could mean nobody knowing who you are online.
  The former is a matter of confidentiality, while the latter is a matter of anonymity. And surprisingly, most of the time at least one of them seems to be conpromised.
  For example, I could be in the Tor network to make myself "private," but Tor only provides anonymity and not confidentiality; it does not encrypt what you are doing.
  Therefore, I would be compromising my identity if I don't have a clear idea of what kind of protection I'm actually getting and do something specific enough to reveal myself, such as logging into Facebook.
  It seems this is one of the reasons why I have hard time talking about privacy; the scope of the topic is just too wide and vague.</h4>
<h4> In my mind, now I break down computer security to two categories: Data and activity.
  If the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) rule is in regards to the data you posess, I would say different rules apply to your computer activity.
  Those rules are confidentiality and anonymity. Just like the scenario above, the tor network only provides anonymity, but not confidentiality. This is fine as long as you are doing anything but personal.
  If you need to do anything personal, anonymity is already compromised; the servers will know who you are because only you would look for something about you (at least most likely you).
  However, you can at least try to achieve confidentiality by encrypting your connection. This way, no one will know exactly what you are doing, except for the metadata.
  In this day where privacy is easily violated, it seems the way to seek security is no longer by having a list of rules for technology to follow,
  but instead to cherry-pick what we can achieve at minimum.

<h4>How to assess security:<br>
1. List out all physical ways to access your personal data. Laptops, phones, any kind of computer with a browser, etc.<br>
2. Think of all the data categories you have: mails, cloud synced notes, photos, etc. List from which physical access point each data must be accessed. Try to have as minimum number of access points per category.<br>
3. Think what is required to breach each access point and count the number of layers. The more important a data is, it should require more breaches to access it and less ways to breach each layer.<br>
4. Think of ways to increase the number of layers to breach. Do not worry if data is spread across devices. As long as each devices are secured to a maximum, it should be fine. As an old saying goes, “If you are running from a bear, you don’t have to be the fastest. You just don’t want to be the slowest."

<h4>Your data is like a basketball. When you play ball, you should hold onto your ball like it's glued to your hand. Your opponent can try to snatch it from you or punch it away, but you should be holding so tight that it's hard to do so. Eventually you will get tired and the ball might slip away from your hands, but that's only if you don't do anything about it. Data protection is like your firm hands; protecting what's yours with security so you buy enough time to do something about your data. The catch here is that, just like basketball, you must be better than your opponent; if you decide to do something about your data, what will you do so it's harder only for the hacker to get?</h4>
<h4>The basketball analogy also brings up an important point about data protection: the protection does not have sides. It is always equally hard for both you and the opponent to get the ball and protect it. The more energy you want to make the opponent use to steal what's yours, the more energy you must spend protecting it. This is all the case because data is fundamentally something separate from us. It is neither under our control nor is in our body.</h4>

<h4>Imagine your data as a heart. It’s something you cannot live without and so important that someone else can control your life if they hold it. Now, there is no way to hide your heart. So if someone decides to go for your heart, they can try to get it. Question is, will you stop your heart before they get it, find a way to live without the heart, or find something to replace the heart?</h4>

<h4>"Privacy is to be isolated from the presence of other beings." - A wise man</h4>
<h4>If I care only about myself and I just want to live my life, I don’t care about privacy because I don’t care whether the others are involved in my life or not. I care about privacy because I want to make a better world, affect people, restructure the way the world works, which also means that there must be a space where I can be safe in, a place where I am free from criticism, a place to store knowledge the world is not yet ready for, a place to test and experiment thoughts: a private space.</h4>

<h4>"You are thinking about it all the time. Maybe you should take your mind off of it for a while."</h4>
<h4>This was the last advice I heard after failing to attach the bezel to the tablet for the third time. And two months later, I've finally found a solution: Super glue.</h4>
