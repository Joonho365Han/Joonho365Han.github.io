<h4>Imagine your data is like a heart. It’s something you cannot live without and so important that someone else can control your life if they hold it. Now, there is no way to hide your heart. So if someone decides to go for your heart, they can try to get it. Question is, will you stop your heart before they get it, find a way to live without the heart, or find something to replace the heart?</h4>

<h4>"Privacy is to be isolated from the presence of other beings." - A wise man</h4>
<h4>If I care only about myself and I just want to live my life, I don’t care about privacy because I don’t care whether the others are involved in my life or not. I care about privacy because I want to make a better world, affect people, restructure the way the world works, which also means that there must be a space where I can be safe in, a place where I am free from criticism, a place to store knowledge the world is not yet ready for, a place to test and experiment thoughts: a private space.</h4>
