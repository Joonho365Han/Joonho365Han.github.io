<h4>"Privacy is to be isolated from the presence of other beings." - A wise man</h4>
<h4>If I care only about myself and I just want to live my life, I don’t care about privacy because I don’t care whether the others are involved in my life or not. I care about privacy because I want to make a better world, affect people, restructure the way the world works, which also means that there must be a space where I can be safe in, a place where I am free from criticism, a place to store knowledge the world is not ready yet for, a place to test and experiment thoughts: a private space.</h4>

<h4>This was the last advice I heard after failing to attach the bezel to the tablet for the third time. And two months later, I've finally found a solution: Super glue.</h4>
