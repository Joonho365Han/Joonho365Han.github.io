		        	<h2>SELTRA</h2>
		        	<h4>Seltra is a concept of a definitive, most beautiful personal object. I attempted several times to create a permanent version since 2008. However, on December 2015, I concluded that it's impossible to finalize the object, because I will grow and change as a person and so will my definition of beauty. Each rendition of Seltra meant many things throughout my life, depending on what I sought the most at a point. It would be fair to say that I felt 'pride' for the first time when I finally completed the very first version of Seltra.</h4>
		        	<h4>(Note: Throughout the page, I will only describe the creation of the latest version in detail, as I did not take any pictures of older ones when I was young.)</h4>
		        	<h3>Significance</h3>
		        	<h4>Seltra represented different things throughout my life. As a kid, all I wanted was just a cool toy. When I started making my own Seltra, however, it started to hold more meaning than just a toy.</h4>
		        	<h4>The first meaning is, "Do not give up." When I was in junior high in Korea, I grew up with people who didn't believe art was necessary in life, who would sometimes steal and hide my creations. However, I did not mind those who do, and one day, I successfully created the first wristband-style Seltra. No matter how hard anything seems, what you believe in will determine the outcome.</h4>
		        	<h4>The second meaning is "ultimate beauty." I believe that a person's greed can be satisfied by creating a perfectly customized object. In my case, I am obsessed with beautiful things, and I thought Seltra was the most beautiful thing in the world. This assumption prevented me from relying on luxury to make myself happier. Today, since it's difficult to clearly define beauty, Seltra lost this meaning and functionality. Interestingly, however, my obsession with beauty subsided as well, as if Seltra adjusts itself to my needs.</h4>

		       <h3>Design</h3>
	        	<h4>The official definition of Seltra was coined after I created the first wristband version, but I always had my own treasure since I was a kid. As a child, all I did was to simply decorate a crayon's wrapping paper and pretend it to be a laser shooter. I also heavily wrapped aluminum foil around it so the crayon wouldn't break or scratch due to shock. This "wrapping" would later motivate me to create wooden containers in which I would store Seltra. Over time, I learned how to sculpt, woodwork, and learned about acrylic paint. I started to think more out of the box, and this led me to create a wristband version.</h4>

	        	<h3>Production</h3>	
	        	<h4>The goal was to produce an everlasting object, something that could be easily maintained. I chose stainless steel for the main body, as it was the most accessible and considerably durable material. The body was 3-D printed, but 3-D printed steel isn't always smooth and has many 'pores.' Thus, I had to polish the piece myself. This was done mostly by milling the surface flat and brush sanding any intricate corners by hand.</h4>
	        	<h4>Through testing many sculptures that would look good inside the body, I learned three things. First, 3 dimensional design looks fuller and satisfying. Second, don't submerge anything small in liquid, as it will look flat. Third, art is content, not design. Design makes the content stand out, and blends into the background.</h4>
