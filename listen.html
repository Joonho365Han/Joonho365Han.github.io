                <h3>Introduction</h3>
        		<h4>Listen is a series of interviews in which I attempt to capture when we are most ourselves. Through this work, I hope to learn what aspect of a person helps us feel compassion to each other. Initially, I borrowed the recording style from Lynn Hirschberg's Screen Tests, but hopefully the series will evolve and present each person with different styles. This is an ongoing project, and will mature as I meet different people.</h4>
        		<h3>Motivation</h3>
        		<h4>I came to the states at the beginning of high school, eager to live a different life. In my memory, my middle school was very judgmental, but I was much more than a paper. I had artistic hobbies and had a distinct personality, and hoped to be more accepted when I came to the states. When I came over, however, I decided to throw myself away. In Korea, I learned what "normal" looked like so I could communicate with normal people. To learn what's normal in the U.S., I thought throwing myself away was necessary. Years later, I would realize I should be proud of who I am, but had already forgotten about what defined me as a person. I wanted to see how others defined themselves and started to interview them, which would become "Listen".</h4>
        		<h4>Today, Listen has a different purpose since I have a better sense of who I am. More through time, I realize how diverse America is. People who avoid me because I do not "fit in" still exists, while there are others who are much more accepting. In other words, there is no true normal person. I was surprised how so many different people could relate to each other without a definition of normality. From that moment, Listen pursued its current goal, focusing on interpersonal relationships.</h4>
