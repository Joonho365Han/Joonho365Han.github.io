                <h4>Listen is a series of interviews in which I try to capture each individual's "human beauty." It is difficult to explain "human beauty," as everyone has their own appeals and the definition of beauty is subjective. Therefore, it is possible that the interviewee could have his "human beauty" completely unnoticed by the interviewer, me. However, part of the goal for this interview is to bring out the hidden attraction within every soul, so they can hopefully have something of their own after they leave. This is an ongoing project, and hopefully the series will evolve and present each person with a style emphasizing their character.</h4>
        		<h3>Motivation</h3>
                <h4>Do you value your virtues? When I was young, the only thing I cared was to become part of the crowd. Virtues for me were only tools to become accepted by the masses, just so I do not feel left out. This made me very "unattractive." I lost friends, became lonely, and finally started to think, "becoming a part of the crowd isn't big enough of a reason to live." I searched for my own meaning of life, and I started this interview series to peek into other people's memories; I wanted to learn from the paths the others took. Years later, I found my own life, but other people's paths of life still intrigued me.</h4>
